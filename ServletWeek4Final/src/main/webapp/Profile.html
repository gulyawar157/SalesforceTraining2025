    <strong>History of Programming Languages:</strong><br><br>
    The journey of programming languages began in the early 1950s with 
    assembly languages and machine code. Soon after, Fortran (1957) 
    became the first widely used high-level programming language, designed 
    for scientific and mathematical calculations.  
    <br><br>
    In the 1960s, languages like COBOL (for business applications) 
    and Lisp (for artificial intelligence research) appeared.  
    The 1970s gave us C, which combined efficiency and flexibility 
    and became the foundation of modern operating systems like UNIX.  
    <br><br>
    The 1980s introduced object-oriented programming with languages 
    like C++, making software more modular and reusable.  
    The 1990s broughtJava and Python, which focused on 
    portability, simplicity, and readability.  
    <br><br>
    In the 2000s and beyond, modern languages such as JavaScript, 
    C#, Go, and Rust emerged, focusing on web development, 
    concurrency, and safety. Today, programming continues to evolve to 
    meet the demands of cloud computing, AI, and large-scale systems.
